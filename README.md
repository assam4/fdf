FDF is a project of school 42 aimed at understanding the graphical interface and writing a program that works with windows and with the image.
Highlights The project is divided into several parts for better understanding and design .
● Library that we can use,
● Validation_checkers,
● Matrix structure implementation,
● Graphic functions and t_data structure implementation (need to be for with library mlx( X11, opengl framework),

While working with the window, the user has the ability to manipulate the displayed object using these keys.
● ' ←, →, ↑, ↓ '  --   to move the object itself.
● 'c'             --   changes color.
● 'i'             --   transform to isometric projection (by default).
● 'p'             --   transform to perspective projection.
● 'x'             --   rotate_x.
● 'y'             --   rotate_y.
● 'z'             --   rotate_z.
● '+'             --   zoom-in.
● '-'             --   zoom-out.
